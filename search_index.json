to KAIST CS330's Pintos project.\nIn this semester, we will use modified version of the pintos that is specially\ntailored for KAIST's CS330 class. The modification include followings:\n\nSwitch 8086 to x86-64: Who use 32bit architecture nowadays?\nMake pintos works on the modern linux kernel (e.g. ubuntu 18.04 LTS).\nSlightly modified goals: Adjusting according to the KAIST CS330 class.\nAdditional goals: Makes you challenging!\n\nPlease notice that since the requirements are somewhat differed from the\nvanilla one, YOU SHOULD FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTION OF THIS MANUAL FIRST.\nAlso, you can refer the YOUR OWN previous pintos project, but you need to\nreimplemented some of the requirements according to the updated one.\nAll the changes lead instructors to modify the manual. Although instructors\ntried to synchronize the manual with modified version, there may exist\nunsynchronized sections. If you find them, please notice to instructors.\nYOU MUST READ\nLegal and Ethical Issues SECTION.\nThe pintos-kaist is a simple operating system framework for the x86-64\narchitecture. This project forked from the pintos project from the stanford\nuniversity. Pintos (we will use Pintos rather than pintos-kaist from now)\nsupports kernel threads, loading and running user programs,\nand a file system, but it implements all of these in a very simple way. In the\nPintos projects, you and your project team will strengthen its support in all\nthree of these areas. You will also add a virtual memory implementation. Pintos\ncould, theoretically, run on a regular x86-64 PC. Unfortunately, it is\nimpractical to supply every CS330 student a dedicated PC for use with Pintos.\nTherefore, we will run Pintos projects in a system simulator, that is, a program\nthat simulates an x86-64 CPU and its peripheral devices accurately enough that\nunmodified operating systems and software can run under it. In class we will use\nthe QEMU simulators. These projects are hard. CS330 has a reputation of\ntaking a lot of time, and deservedly so. We will do what we can to reduce the\nworkload, such as providing a lot of support material, but there is plenty of\nhard work that needs to be done. We welcome your feedback. If you have\nsuggestions on how we can reduce the unnecessary overhead of assignments,\ncutting them down to the important underlying issues, please let us know. This\nchapter explains how to get started working with Pintos. You should read the\nentire chapter before you start work on any of the projects.\n"},"introduction/getting_started.html":{"url":"introduction/getting_started.html","title":"Getting Started","keywords":"","body":"Getting Started\nTo get started, you'll have to log into a machine that Pintos can be built on.\nYou may use given Linux machines by the intructors or your own Solaris or Linux\nmachines. However, we will test your code on given machines, and the\ninstructions given here assume this environment. We cannot provide support for\ninstalling and working on Pintos on your own machine. Belows server environment\nwill be given to each student.\nNow you can get the source code for Pintos into a directory name 'pintos',\nby executing:\ngit clone https://github.com/casys-kaist/pintos-kaist\n\nHowever, the source codes are likely to be changed before the project\nperiod, we recommend you to duplicate the\nrepository.\nWhen we change the template code, you can\neasily synchronize\nyour code with the template. Please NOT TO MAKE PUBLIC FORK.\nWe will never change the source code during the project period, except\nfor the critical bug lies on the template code.\nFYI. We have tested the pintos code and the solution on the Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS\nwith gcc (gcc (Ubuntu 7.4.0-1ubuntu1~16.04~ppa1) 7.4.0) and qemu-system-x86_64\n(QEMU emulator version 2.5.0 (Debian 1:2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.43)), same as the\ngiven linux machine.\nOnce you've retrived source code, you can set up your environment with below\ncommand in pintos root directory:\n$ source ./activate\n\nIt is a good idea to add this line to the '.bashrc' in your home directory.\nOtherwise, you'll have to type it every time you log in.\nSource Tree Overview\nLet's take a look at what's inside. Here's the directory structure that you\nshould see in pintos/\n\nthreads/: Source code for the base kernel, which you will modify starting in\nproject 1.\nuserprog/: Source code for the user program loader, which you will modify\nstarting with project 2.\nvm/: An almost empty directory. You will implement virtual memory here in\nproject 3.\nfilesys/: Source code for a basic file system. You will use this file system\nstarting with project 2, but you will not modify it until project 4.\ndevices/: Source code for I/O device interfacing: keyboard, timer, disk,\netc. You will modify the timer implementation in project 1. Otherwise you\nshould have no need to change this code.\nlib/: An implementation of a subset of the standard C library. The code in\nthis directory is compiled into both the Pintos kernel and, starting from\nproject 2, user programs that run under it. You should have little need to\nmodify this code.\ninclude/lib/kernel/: Parts of the C library that are included only in the\nPintos kernel. This also includes implementations of some data types that you\nare free to use in your kernel code: bitmaps, doubly linked lists, and\nhash tables. In the kernel, headers in this directory can be included using\nthe #include  notation.\ninclude/lib/user/: Parts of the C library that are included only in Pintos\nuser programs. In user programs, headers in this directory can be included\nusing the #include  notation.\ntests/: Tests for each project. You can modify this code if it helps you\ntest your submission, but we will replace it with the originals before we run\nthe tests.\nexamples/: Example user programs for use starting with project 2.\ninclude/: Source code for the header files (*.h).\n\nBuilding Pintos\nAs the next step, build the source code supplied for the first project. First,\ncd into the threads directory. Then, issue the make command.\nThis will create a build directory under threads, populate it with a\nMakefile and a few subdirectories, and then build the kernel inside.\nFollowing the build, the following are the interesting files in the build\ndirectory:\n\nMakefile: A copy of pintos/src/Makefile.build. It describes how to build\nthe kernel.\nkernel.o: Object file for the entire kernel. This is the result of linking\nobject files compiled from each individual kernel source file into a single\nobject file. It contains debug information, so you can run GDB\n(see GDB) or backtrace\n(Backtraces) on it.\nkernel.bin: Memory image of the kernel, that is, the exact bytes loaded into\nmemory to run the Pintos kernel. This is just kernel.o with debug\ninformation stripped out, which saves a lot of space, which in turn keeps the\nkernel from bumping up against a 512 kB size limit imposed by the kernel\nloader's design.\nloader.bin: Memory image for the kernel loader, a small chunk of code\nwritten in assembly language that reads the kernel from disk into memory and\nstarts it up. It is exactly 512 bytes long, a size fixed by the PC BIOS.\nSubdirectories of build contain object files (.o) and dependency files\n(.d), both produced by the compiler. The dependency files tell make which\nsource files need to be recompiled when other source or header files are\nchanged.\n\nRunning Pintos\nWe've supplied a program for conveniently running Pintos in a simulator, called\npintos. In the simplest case, you can invoke pintos as pintos argument....\nEach argument is passed to the Pintos kernel for it to act on.\nTry it out. First cd into the newly created build directory. Then issue the\ncommand pintos run alarm-multiple, which passes the arguments run alarm-multiple\nto the Pintos kernel. In these arguments, run instructs the kernel to run a test\nand alarm-multiple is the test to run. Pintos boots and runs the alarm-multiple\ntest program, which outputs a few screenfuls of text.\nYou can log serial output to a file by redirecting at the command line,\ne.g. pintos -- run alarm-multiple > logfile. The pintos program offers several\noptions for configuring the qemu or the virtual hardware. If you specify any\noptions, they must precede the commands passed to the Pintos kernel and be\nseparated from them by --, so that the whole command looks like\npintos option... -- argument.... Invoke pintos without any arguments to see a\nlist of available options. Options includes: how you want VM output to be\ndisplayed: use -v to turn off the VGA display, or -s to suppress serial\ninput from stdin and output to stdout. The Pintos kernel has commands and\noptions other than run. These are not very interesting for now, but you can see\na list of them using -h, e.g. pintos -h.\n"},"introduction/grading.html":{"url":"introduction/grading.html","title":"Grading","keywords":"","body":"Grading\nWe will grade your assignments based on test results.\nTesting\nYour test result grade will be based on our tests.\nEach project has several tests, each of which has a name beginning with tests.\nTo completely test your submission, invoke make check from the project build\ndirectory.

Your job\nis to extend the functionality of this system to gain a better understanding of\nsynchronization problems. You will be working primarily in the threads\ndirectory for this assignment, with some work in the devices directory on the\nside. Compilation should be done in the threads directory.\nBefore you read the description of this project, you should at least skim the\nmaterial Synchronization.\nBackground\nUnderstanding Threads\nThe first step is to read and understand the code for the initial thread system.\nPintos already implements thread creation and thread completion, a simple\nscheduler to switch between threads, and synchronization primitives\n(semaphores, locks, condition variables, and optimization barriers).\nSome of this code might seem slightly mysterious. If you haven't already\ncompiled and run the base system, as described in the\nintroduction you should do so now.\nYou can read through parts of the source code to see what's going on. If you\nlike, you can add calls to printf() almost anywhere, then recompile and run to\nsee what happens and in what order. You can also run the kernel in a debugger\nand set breakpoints at interesting spots, single-step through code and examine\ndata, and so on.\nWhen a thread is created, you are creating a new context to be scheduled. You\nprovide a function to be run in this context as an argument to thread_create().\nThe first time the thread is scheduled and runs, it starts from the beginning of\nthat function and executes in that context. When the function returns, the\nthread terminates. Each thread, therefore, acts like a mini-program running\ninside Pintos, with the function passed to thread_create() acting like\nmain().\nAt any given time, exactly one thread runs and the rest, if any, become\ninactive. The scheduler decides which thread to run next. (If no thread is ready\nto run at any given time, then the special idle thread, implemented in\nidle(), runs.) Synchronization primitives can force context switches when one\nthread needs to wait for another thread to do something.\nThe mechanics of a context switch are in thread_launch() in threads/thread.c\n(You don't have to understand it.) It saves the state of the currently\nrunning thread and restores the state of the thread we're switching to.\nUsing the GDB debugger, slowly trace through a context switch to see what\nhappens (see GDB). You can set a breakpoint on schedule() to start out,\nand then single-step from there. Be sure to keep track of each thread's address\nand state, and what procedures are on the call stack for each thread. You will\nnotice that when one thread executes iret in do_iret(), another thread\nstarts running.\nWarning: In Pintos, each thread is assigned a small, fixed-size execution\nstack just under 4 kB in size. The kernel tries to detect stack overflow, but it\ncannot do so perfectly. You may cause bizarre problems, such as mysterious\nkernel panics, if you declare large data structures as non-static local\nvariables, e.g. int buf[1000];. Alternatives to stack allocation include\nthe page allocator and the block allocator (see Memory\nAllocation.)\nSource Files\nHere is a brief overview of the files in the threads, and include/threads\ndirectory. You will not need to modify most of this code, but the hope is that\npresenting this overview will give you a start on what code to look at.\nthreads codes\n\nloader.S, loader.h\nThe kernel loader. Assembles to 512 bytes of code and data that the PC BIOS\nloads into memory and which in turn finds the kernel on disk, loads it into\nmemory, and jumps to bootstrap() in start.S. You should not need to look\nat this code or modify it. start.S does basic setup needed for memory\nprotection and jump into the 64bit long mode. Unlike the loader, this code is\nactually part of the kernel.\n\nkernel.lds.S\nThe linker script used to link the kernel. Sets the load address of the kernel\nand arranges for start.S to be near the beginning of the kernel image.\nAgain, you should not need to look at this code or modify it, but it's here in\ncase you're curious.\n\ninit.c, init.h\nKernel initialization, including main(), the kernel's main program. You\nshould look over main() at least to see what gets initialized. You might\nwant to add your own initialization code here.\n\nthread.c, thread.h\nBasic thread support. Much of your work will take place in these files.\nthread.h defines struct thread, which you are likely to modify in all four\nprojects. See Threads for more information.\n\npalloc.c, palloc.h\nPage allocator, which hands out system memory in multiples of 4 kB pages.\nSee Page Allocator for more\ninformation.\n\nmalloc.c, malloc.h\nA simple implementation of malloc() and free() for the kernel. See\nBlock Allocator for more\ninformation.\n\ninterrupt.c, interrupt.h\nBasic interrupt handling and functions for turning interrupts on and off.\n\nintr-stubs.S, intr-stubs.h\nAssembly code for low-level interrupt handling.\n\nsynch.c, synch.h\nBasic synchronization primitives: semaphores, locks, condition variables, and\noptimization barriers. You will need to use these for synchronization in all\nfour projects. See Synchronization for more\ninformation.\n\nmmu.c, mmu.h\nFunctions for x86-64 page table operations. You will look this file closer\nafter the lab1.\n\nio.h\nFunctions for I/O port access. This is mostly used by source code in the\ndevices directory that you won't have to touch.\n\nvaddr.h, pte.h\nFunctions and macros for working with virtual addresses and page table\nentries. These will be more important to you in project 3. For now, you can\nignore them.\n\nflags.h\nMacros that define a few bits in the x86-64 flags register. Probably of no\ninterest.\n\n\ndevices codes\nThe basic threaded kernel also includes these files in the devices directory:\n\ntimer.c, timer.h\nSystem timer that ticks, by default, 100 times per second. You will modify\nthis code in this project.\n\nvga.c, vga.h\nVGA display driver. Responsible for writing text to the screen. You should\nhave no need to look at this code. printf() calls into the VGA display\ndriver for you, so there's little reason to call this code yourself.\n\nserial.c, serial.h\nSerial port driver. Again, printf() calls this code for you, so you don't\nneed to do so yourself. It handles serial input by passing it to the input\nlayer (see below).\n\nblock.c, block.h\nAn abstraction layer for block devices, that is, random-access, disk-like\ndevices that are organized as arrays of fixed-size blocks. Out of the box,\nPintos supports two types of block devices: IDE disks and partitions. Block\ndevices, regardless of type, won't actually be used until project 2.\n\nide.c, ide.h\nSupports reading and writing sectors on up to 4 IDE disks.\n\npartition.c, partition.h\nUnderstands the structure of partitions on disks, allowing a single disk to be\ncarved up into multiple regions (partitions) for independent use.\n\nkbd.c, kbd.h\nKeyboard driver. Handles keystrokes passing them to the input layer\n(see below).\n\ninput.c, input.h\nInput layer. Queues input characters passed along by the keyboard or serial\ndrivers.\n\nintq.c, intq.h\nInterrupt queue, for managing a circular queue that both kernel threads and\ninterrupt handlers want to access. Used by the keyboard and serial drivers.\n\nrtc.c, rtc.h\nReal-time clock driver, to enable the kernel to determine the current date and\ntime. By default, this is only used by thread/init.c to choose an initial\nseed for the random number generator.\n\nspeaker.c, speaker.h\nDriver that can produce tones on the PC speaker.\n\npit.c, pit.h\nCode to configure the 8254 Programmable Interrupt Timer. This code is used\nby both devices/timer.c and devices/speaker.c because each device uses\none of the PIT's output channel.\n\n\nlib codes\nFinally, lib and lib/kernel contain useful library routines. (lib/user\nwill be used by user programs, starting in project 2, but it is not part of the\nkernel.) Here's a few more details:\n\nctype.h, inttypes.h, limits.h, stdarg.h, stdbool.h, stddef.h,\nstdint.h, stdio.c, stdio.h, stdlib.c, stdlib.h, string.c,\nstring.h\nA subset of the standard C library.\n\ndebug.c, debug.h\nFunctions and macros to aid debugging. See Debugging Tools for more\ninformation.\n\nrandom.c, random.h\nPseudo-random number generator. The actual sequence of random values will\nnot vary from one Pintos run to another.\n\nround.h\nMacros for rounding.\n\nsyscall-nr.h\nSystem call numbers. Not used until project 2.\n\nkernel/list.c, kernel/list.h\nDoubly linked list implementation. Used all over the Pintos code, and you'll\nprobably want to use it a few places yourself in project 1. We recommand you\nto skim this code before you start (especially comments in the header file.)\n\nkernel/bitmap.c, kernel/bitmap.h\nBitmap implementation. You can use this in your code if you like, but you\nprobably won't have any need for it in project 1.\n\nkernel/hash.c, kernel/hash.h\nHash table implementation. Likely to come in handy for project 3.\n\nkernel/console.c, kernel/console.h, kernel/stdio.h\nImplements printf() and a few other functions.\n\n\nSynchronization\nProper synchronization is an important part of the solutions to these problems.\nAny synchronization problem can be easily solved by turning interrupts off:\nwhile interrupts are off, there is no concurrency, so there's no possibility for\nrace conditions. Therefore, it's tempting to solve all synchronization problems\nthis way, but don't. Instead, use semaphores, locks, and condition variables to\nsolve the bulk of your synchronization problems. Read the tour section on\nsynchronization (see Synchronization) or the\ncomments in threads/synch.c if you're unsure what synchronization primitives\nmay be used in what situations.\nIn the Pintos projects, the only class of problem best solved by disabling\ninterrupts is coordinating data shared between a kernel thread and an interrupt\nhandler. Because interrupt handlers can't sleep, they can't acquire locks.\nThis means that data shared between kernel threads and an interrupt handler must\nbe protected within a kernel thread by turning off interrupts.\nThis project only requires accessing a little bit of thread state from\ninterrupt handlers. For the alarm clock, the timer interrupt needs to wake up\nsleeping threads. In the advanced scheduler, the timer interrupt needs to access\na few global and per-thread variables. When you access these variables from\nkernel threads, you will need to disable interrupts to prevent the timer\ninterrupt from interfering.\nWhen you do turn off interrupts, take care to do so for the least amount of code\npossible, or you can end up losing important things such as timer ticks or input\nevents. Turning off interrupts also increases the interrupt handling latency,\nwhich can make a machine feel sluggish if taken too far.\nThe synchronization primitives themselves in synch.c are implemented by\ndisabling interrupts. You may need to increase the amount of code that runs with\ninterrupts disabled here, but you should still try to keep it to a minimum.\nDisabling interrupts can be useful for debugging, if you want to make sure that\na section of code is not interrupted. You should remove debugging code before\nturning in your project. (Don't just comment it out, because that can make the\ncode difficult to read.)\nThere should be no busy waiting in your submission. A tight loop that calls\nthread_yield() is one form of busy waiting.\nDevelopment Suggestions\nIn the past, many groups divided the assignment into pieces, then each group\nmember worked on his or her piece until just before the deadline, at which time\nthe group reconvened to combine their code and submit. This is a bad idea. We do\nnot recommend this approach. Groups that do this often find that two changes\nconflict with each other, requiring lots of last-minute debugging. Some groups\nwho have done this have turned in code that did not even compile or boot,\nmuch less pass any tests.\nInstead, we recommend integrating your team's changes early and often, using a\nsource code control system such as git.\nThis is less likely to produce surprises, because everyone can see everyone\nelse's code as it is written, instead of just when it is finished. These systems\nalso make it possible to review changes and, when a change introduces a bug,\ndrop back to working versions of code.\nYou should expect to run into bugs that you simply don't understand while\nworking on this and subsequent projects. When you do, reread the appendix on\ndebugging tools, which is filled with useful debugging tips that should help you\nto get back up to speed (see Debugging Tools). Be sure to read the section\non backtraces (see Backtraces), which will help you to get the most out of\nevery kernel panic or assertion failure.\n"},"project1/alarm_clock.html":{"url":"project1/alarm_clock.html","title":"Alarm Clock","keywords":"","body":"Alarm Clock\nReimplement timer_sleep(), defined in devices/timer.c.\nAlthough a working implementation is provided, it busy waits, that is,\nit spins in a loop checking the current time and calling thread_yield() until\nenough time has gone by.

Similarly, when threads are waiting for a lock,\nsemaphore, or condition variable, the highest priority waiting thread should be\nawakened first. A thread may raise or lower its own priority at any time,\nbut lowering its priority such that it no longer has the highest priority must\ncause it to immediately yield the CPU.\nThread priorities range from PRI_MIN (0) to PRI_MAX (63). Lower numbers\ncorrespond to lower priorities, so that priority 0 is the lowest priority and\npriority 63 is the highest. The initial thread priority is passed as an argument\nto thread_create(). If there's no reason to choose another priority, use\nPRI_DEFAULT (31). The PRI_ macros are defined in threads/thread.h, and you\nshould not change their values.\nOne issue with priority scheduling is \"priority inversion\". Consider high,\nmedium, and low priority threads H, M, and L, respectively. If H needs\nto wait for L (for instance, for a lock held by L), and M is on the ready\nlist, then H will never get the CPU because the low priority thread will not\nget any CPU time. A partial fix for this problem is for H to \"donate\" its\npriority to L while L is holding the lock, then recall the donation once L\nreleases (and thus H acquires) the lock.\nImplement priority donation. You will need to account for all different\nsituations in which priority donation is required. Be sure to handle multiple\ndonations, in which multiple priorities are donated to a single thread. You must\nalso handle nested donation: if H is waiting on a lock that M holds and M\nis waiting on a lock that L holds, then both M and L should be boosted to\nH's priority. If necessary, you may impose a reasonable limit on depth of\nnested priority donation, such as 8 levels.\nYou must implement priority donation for locks. You need not implement priority\ndonation for the other Pintos synchronization constructs. You do need to\nimplement priority scheduling in all cases.\nFinally, implement the following functions that allow a thread to examine and\nmodify its own priority. Skeletons for these functions are provided in\nthreads/thread.c.\n\nvoid thread_set_priority (int new_priority);\n\n\nSets the current thread's priority to new priority.

However, the advanced scheduler does not do priority\ndonation. Thus, we recommend that you have the priority scheduler working,\nexcept possibly for priority donation, before you start work on the advanced\nscheduler.\nYou must write your code to allow us to choose a scheduling algorithm policy at\nPintos startup time. By default, the priority scheduler must be active, but we\nmust be able to choose the 4.4BSD scheduler with the -mlfqs kernel option.\nPassing this option sets thread_mlfqs, declared in threads/thread.h, to true\nwhen the options are parsed by parse_options(), which happens early in\nmain().\nWhen the 4.4BSD scheduler is enabled, threads no longer directly control their\nown priorities. The priority argument to thread_create() should be ignored,\nas well as any calls to thread_set_priority(), and thread_get_priority()\nshould return the thread's current priority as set by the scheduler. The\nadvanced scheduler is not used in any later project.\n4.4BSD Scheduler\nThe goal of a general-purpose scheduler is to balance threads' different\nscheduling needs. Threads that perform a lot of I/O require a fast response time\nto keep input and output devices busy, but need little CPU time. On the other\nhand, compute-bound threads need to receive a lot of CPU time to finish their\nwork, but have no requirement for fast response time. Other threads lie\nsomewhere in between, with periods of I/O punctuated by periods of computation,\nand thus have requirements that vary over time. A well-designed scheduler\ncan often accommodate threads with all these requirements simultaneously.\nFor project 1, you must implement the scheduler described in this appendix. Our\nscheduler resembles the one described in [McKusick], which is one example of a\nmultilevel feedback queue scheduler. This type of scheduler maintains several\nqueues of ready-to-run threads, where each queue holds threads with a different\npriority. At any given time, the scheduler chooses a thread from the\nhighest-priority non-empty queue. If the highest-priority queue contains\nmultiple threads, then they run in \"round robin\" order.\nMultiple facets of the scheduler require data to be updated after a certain\nnumber of timer ticks. In every case, these updates should occur before any\nordinary kernel thread has a chance to run, so that there is no chance that a\nkernel thread could see a newly increased timer_ticks() value but old\nscheduler data values.\nThe 4.4BSD scheduler does not include priority donation.\nNiceness\nThread priority is dynamically determined by the scheduler using a formula given\nbelow. However, each thread also has an integer nice value that determines how\n\"nice\" the thread should be to other threads. A nice of zero does not affect\nthread priority. A positive nice, to the maximum of 20, decreases the priority\nof a thread and causes it to give up some CPU time it would otherwise receive.\nOn the other hand, a negative nice, to the minimum of -20, tends to take away\nCPU time from other threads.\nThe initial thread starts with a nice value of zero. Other threads start with a\nnice value inherited from their parent thread. You must implement the functions\ndescribed below, which are for use by test programs. We have provided skeleton\ndefinitions for them in threads/thread.c\nint thread_get_nice (void);\n\n\nReturns the current thread's nice value.\n\nint thread_set_nice (void);\n\n\nSets the current thread's nice value to new nice and recalculates the thread's\npriority based on the new value\n(see Calculating Priority). If the running thread no\nlonger has the highest priority, yields.\n\nCalculating Priority\nOur scheduler has 64 priorities and thus 64 ready queues, numbered 0 (PRI_MIN)\nthrough 63 (PRI_MAX). Lower numbers correspond to lower priorities, so that\npriority 0 is the lowest priority and priority 63 is the highest. Thread\npriority is calculated initially at thread initialization. It is also\nrecalculated once every fourth clock tick, for every thread. In either\ncase, it is determined by the formula:\n\npriority = PRI_MAX - (recent_cpu / 4) - (nice * 2),\n\nwhere recent cpu is an estimate of the CPU time the thread has used recently\n(see below) and nice is the thread's nice value. The result should be rounded\ndown to the nearest integer (truncated). The coefficients 1/4 and 2 on recent\ncpu and nice, respectively, have been found to work well in practice but lack\ndeeper meaning. The calculated priority is always adjusted to lie in the valid\nrange PRI_MIN to PRI_MAX.\nThis formula gives a thread that has received CPU time recently lower priority\nfor being reassigned the CPU the next time the scheduler runs. This is key to\npreventing starvation: a thread that has not received any CPU time recently will\nhave a recent cpu of 0, which barring a high nice value should ensure that it\nreceives CPU time soon.\nCalculating recent_cpu\nWe wish recent cpu to measure how much CPU time each process has received\n\"recently.\" Furthermore, as a refinement, more recent CPU time should be\nweighted more heavily than less recent CPU time. One approach would use an array\nof n elements to track the CPU time received in each of the last n seconds.\nHowever, this approach requires O(n) space per thread and O(n) time per\ncalculation of a new weighted average.\nInstead, we use a exponentially weighted moving average, which takes this\ngeneral form:\n\nx(0) = f(0),\nx(t) = ax(t − 1) + (1 − a)f(t),\na = k/(k + 1),\n\nwhere x(t) is the moving average at integer time t ≥ 0, f(t) is the\nfunction being averaged, and k > 0 controls the rate of decay. We can iterate\nthe formula over a few steps as follows:\n\nx(1) = f(1),\nx(2) = af(1) + f(2),\n...\nx(5) = a^4 * f(1) + a^3 * f(2) + a^2 * f(3) + a * f(4) + f(5).\n\nThe value of f(t) has a weight of 1 at time t, a weight of a at time\nt + 1, a^2 at time t + 2, and so on. We can also relate x(t) to k:\nf(t) has a weight of approximately 1/e at time t + k, approximately\n1/(e^2) at time t + 2k, and so on. From the opposite direction, f(t)\ndecays to weight w at time t + log_a(w).\nThe initial value of recent_cpu is 0 in the first thread created, or the\nparent's value in other new threads. Each time a timer interrupt occurs,\nrecent_cpu is incremented by 1 for the running thread only, unless the idle\nthread is running. In addition, once per second the value of recent cpu is\nrecalculated for every thread (whether running, ready, or blocked), using this\nformula:\n\nrecent_cpu = (2 * load_avg)/(2 * load_avg + 1) * recent_cpu + nice\n\nwhere load_avg is a moving average of the number of threads ready to run (see\nbelow). If load_avg is 1, indicating that a single thread, on average, is\ncompeting for the CPU, then the current value of recent cpu decays to a weight\nof .1 in log_(2/3) .1 ≈ 6 seconds; if load avg is 2, then decay to a weight\nof .1 takes log_(3/4) .1 ≈ 8 seconds. The effect is that recent cpu\nestimates the amount of CPU time the thread has received \"recently,\" with the\nrate of decay inversely proportional to the number of threads competing for the\nCPU.\nAssumptions made by some of the tests require that these recalculations of\nrecent cpu be made exactly when the system tick counter reaches a multiple of\na second, that is, when timer_ticks () % TIMER_FREQ == 0, and not at any other\ntime.\nThe value of recent_cpu can be negative for a thread with a negative nice value.\nDo not clamp negative recent_cpu to 0.\nYou may need to think about the order of calculations in this formula. We\nrecommend computing the coefficient of recent cpu first, then multiplying. Some\nstudents have reported that multiplying load_avg by recent_cpu directly can\ncause overflow.\nYou must implement thread_get_recent_cpu(), for which there is a skeleton in\nthreads/thread.c.\nint thread_get_recent_cpu (void);\n\n\nReturns 100 times the current thread's recent cpu value, rounded to the\nnearest integer\n\nCalculating load_avg\nFinally, load avg, often known as the system load average, estimates the average\nnumber of threads ready to run over the past minute. Like recent_cpu, it is an\nexponentially weighted moving average. Unlike priority and recent_cpu,\nload_avg is system-wide, not thread-specific. At system boot, it is\ninitialized to 0. Once per second thereafter, it is updated according to the\nfollowing formula:\n\nload_avg = (59/60) * load_avg + (1/60) * ready_threads,\n\nwhere ready threads is the number of threads that are either running or ready to\nrun at time of update (not including the idle thread).\nBecause of assumptions made by some of the tests, load_avg must be updated\nexactly when the system tick counter reaches a multiple of a second, that is,\nwhen timer_ticks () % TIMER_FREQ == 0, and not at any other time.\nYou must implement thread_get_load_avg(), for which there is a skeleton in\nthreads/thread.c.\nint thread_get_load_avg (void)\n\n\nReturns 100 times the current system load average, rounded to the nearest\ninteger.\n\nSummary\nThe following formulas summarize the calculations required to implement the\nscheduler. They are not a complete description of scheduler requirements.\nEvery thread has a nice value between -20 and 20 directly under its control.\nEach thread also has a priority, between 0 (PRI_MIN) through 63 (PRI_MAX),\nwhich is recalculated using the following formula every fourth tick:\n\npriority = PRI_MAX - (recent_cpu / 4) - (nice * 2)\n\nrecent_cpu measures the amount of CPU time a thread has received \"recently.\"\nOn each timer tick, the running thread's recent cpu is incremented by 1. Once\nper second, every thread's recent cpu is updated this way:\n\nrecent_cpu = (2 * load_avg) / (2 * load_avg + 1) * recent_cpu + nice\n\nload_avg estimates the average number of threads ready to run over the past\nminute. It is initialized to 0 at boot and recalculated once per second as\nfollows:\n\nload_avg = (59/60) * load_avg + (1/60) * ready_threads\n\nwhere ready_threads is the number of threads that are either running or ready\nto run at time of update (not including the idle thread).\nFixed-Point Real Arithmetic\nIn the formulas above, priority, nice, and ready_threads are integers, but\nrecent_cpu and load_avg are real numbers. Unfortunately, Pintos does not\nsupport floating-point arithmetic in the kernel, because it would complicate and\nslow the kernel. Real kernels often have the same limitation, for the same\nreason. This means that calculations on real quantities must be simulated using\nintegers. This is not difficult, but many students do not know how to do it.\nThis section explains the basics.\nThe fundamental idea is to treat the rightmost bits of an integer as\nrepresenting a fraction. For example, we can designate the lowest 14 bits of a\nsigned 32-bit integer as fractional bits, so that an integer x represents the\nreal number x/(2^14). This is called a 17.14 fixed-point number\nrepresentation, because there are 17 bits before the decimal point, 14 bits\nafter it, and one sign bit. A number in 17.14 format represents, at maximum, a\nvalue of (231 − 1)/(2^14) ≈ 131,071.999.\nSuppose that we are using a p.q fixed-point format, and let f = 2q. By the\ndefinition above, we can convert an integer or real number into p.q format by\nmultiplying with f. For example, in 17.14 format the fraction 59/60 used in\nthe calculation of load_avg, above, is (59/60)2^14 = 16,110. To convert a\nfixed-point value back to an integer, divide by f. (The normal / operator in\nC rounds toward zero, that is, it rounds positive numbers down and negative\nnumbers up. To round to nearest, add f / 2 to a positive number, or subtract\nit from a negative number, before dividing.)\nMany operations on fixed-point numbers are straightforward. Let x and y be\nfixed-point numbers, and let n be an integer. Then the sum of x and y is\nx + y and their difference is x - y. The sum of x and n is x + n * f;\ndifference, x - n * f; product, x * n; quotient, x / n.\nMultiplying two fixed-point values has two complications. First, the decimal\npoint of the result is q bits too far to the left. Consider that\n(59/60)(59/60) should be slightly less than 1, but\n16,111 × 16,111 = 259,564,321 is much greater than 2^14 = 16,384.\nShifting q bits right, we get 259,564,321/2^14 = 15,842, or about 0.97,\nthe correct answer. Second, the multiplication can overflow even though the\nanswer is representable. For example, 64 in 17.14 format is\n64 × 2^14 = 1,048,576 and its square 64^2 = 4,096 is well within the 17.14\nrange, but 1,048,576^2 = 2^40, greater than the maximum signed 32-bit integer\nvalue 2^31 − 1. An easy solution is to do the multiplication as a 64-bit\noperation. The product of x and y is then ((int64_t) x) * y / f.\nDividing two fixed-point values has opposite issues. The decimal point will be\ntoo far to the right, which we fix by shifting the dividend q bits to the left\nbefore the division. The left shift discards the top q bits of the dividend,\nwhich we can again fix by doing the division in 64 bits. Thus, the quotient when\nx is divided by y is ((int64_t) x) * f / y.\nThis section has consistently used multiplication or division by f, instead of\nq-bit shifts, for two reasons. First, multiplication and division do not have\nthe surprising operator precedence of the C shift operators. Second,\nmultiplication and division are well-defined on negative operands, but the C\nshift operators are not. Take care with these issues in your implementation.\nThe following table summarizes how fixed-point arithmetic operations can be\nimplemented in C. In the table, x and y are fixed-point numbers, n is an\ninteger, fixed-point numbers are in signed p.q format where p + q = 31, and\nf is 1 :\n\n\n\nArithmetic\nC\n\n\n\n\nConvert n to fixed point\nn * f\n\n\nConvert x to integer (rounding toward zero)\nx / f\n\n\nConvert x to integer (rounding to nearest)\n(x + f / 2) / f if x >= 0\n\n\n\n(x - f / 2) / f if x \n\n\nAdd x and y\nx + y\n\n\nSubtract y from x\nx - y\n\n\nAdd x and n\nx + n * f\n\n\nSubtract n from x\nx - n * f\n\n\nMultiply x by y\n((int64_t) x) * y / f\n\n\nMultiply x by n\nx * n\n\n\nDivide x by y\n((int64_t) x) * f / y\n\n\nDivide x by n\nx / n\n\n\n\n"},"project1/FAQ.html":{"url":"project1/FAQ.html","title":"FAQ","keywords":"","body":"FAQ\nHow much code will I need to write?\nHere's a summary of our reference solution, produced by the git diff --stat.\nThe final row gives total lines inserted and deleted; a changed line counts as\nboth an insertion and a deletion.\nThe reference solution represents just one possible solution.

Then run make. If your new file doesn't get compiled,\nrun make clean and then try again. A new .h file does not require editing\nthe Makefiles.\nWhat does warning: no previous prototype for func mean?\nIt means that you defined a non-static function without preceding it by a\nprototype. Because non-static functions are intended for use by other .c\nfiles, for safety they should be prototyped in a header file included before\ntheir definition. To fix the problem, add a prototype in a header file that you\ninclude, or, if the function isn't actually used by other .c files,\nmake it static.\nWhat is the interval between timer interrupts?\nTimer interrupts occur TIMER_FREQ times per second. You can adjust this value\nby editing devices/timer.h. The default is 100 Hz. We don't recommend changing\nthis value, because any changes are likely to cause many of the tests to fail.\nHow long is a time slice?\nThere are TIME_SLICE ticks per time slice. This macro is declared in\nthreads/thread.c. The default is 4 ticks. We don't recommend changing this\nvalue, because any changes are likely to cause many of the tests to fail.\nHow do I run the tests?\nSee Testing.\nWhy do I get a test failure in pass()?\nYou are probably looking at a backtrace that looks something like this:\n0x8004208810: debug_panic (lib/kernel/debug.c:32)\n0x800420a99f: pass (tests/threads/tests.c:93)\n0x800420bdd3: test_mlfqs_load_1 (...threads/mlfqs-load-1.c:33)\n0x800420a8cf: run_test (tests/threads/tests.c:51)\n0x8004200452: run_task (threads/init.c:283)\n0x8004200536: run_actions (threads/init.c:333)\n0x80042000bb: main (threads/init.c:137)\nThis is just confusing output from the backtrace program. It does not actually\nmean that pass() called debug_panic(). In fact, fail() called\ndebug_panic() (via the PANIC() macro). GCC knows that debug_panic() does\nnot return, because it is declared NO_RETURN,\nso it doesn't include any code in fail() to take control when debug_panic()\nreturns. This means that the return address on the stack looks like it is at the\nbeginning of the function that happens to follow fail() in memory, which in\nthis case happens to be pass(). See Backtraces for more information.\nHow do interrupts get re-enabled in the new thread following schedule()?\nEvery path into schedule() disables interrupts. They eventually get re-enabled\nby the next thread to be scheduled. Consider the possibilities: the new thread\nis running in switch_thread() (but see below), which is called by schedule(),\nwhich is called by one of a few possible functions:\n\nthread_exit()\nbut we'll never switch back into such a thread, so it's uninteresting.\nthread_yield()\nwhich immediately restores the interrupt level upon return from schedule().\nthread_block()\nwhich is called from multiple places:\nsema_down()\nwhich immediately restores the interrupt level upon return from schedule().\nidle()\nwhich enables interrupts with an explicit assembly STI instruction.\nwait() in devices/intq.c,\nwhose callers are responsible for reenabling interrupts\n\n\n\nThere is a special case when a newly created thread runs for the first time.\nSuch a thread calls intr_enable() as the first action in kernel_thread(),\nwhich is at the bottom of the call stack for every kernel thread but the first.\nDo I need to account for timer values overflowing?\nDon't worry about the possibility of timer values overflowing. Timer values are\nexpressed as signed 64-bit numbers, which at 100 ticks per second should be\ngood for almost 2,924,712,087 years.\nDoesn't priority scheduling lead to starvation?\nYes, strict priority scheduling can lead to starvation because a thread will not\nrun if any higher-priority thread is runnable. The advanced scheduler introduces\na mechanism for dynamically changing thread priorities. Strict priority\nscheduling is valuable in real-time systems because it offers the programmer\nmore control over which jobs get processing time. High priorities\nare generally reserved for time-critical tasks. It's not \"fair,\" but it\naddresses other concerns not applicable to a general-purpose operating system.\nWhat thread should run after a lock has been released?\nWhen a lock is released, the highest priority thread waiting for that lock\nshould be unblocked and put on the list of ready threads. The scheduler should\nthen run the highest priority thread on the ready list.\nIf the highest-priority thread yields, does it continue running?\nYes. If there is a single highest-priority thread, it continues running until it\nblocks or finishes, even if it calls thread_yield(). If multiple threads have\nthe same highest priority, thread_yield() should switch among them in\n\"round robin\" order.\nWhat happens to the priority of a donating thread?\nPriority donation only changes the priority of the donee thread. The donor\nthread's priority is unchanged. Priority donation is not additive: if thread A\n(with priority 5) donates to thread B (with priority 3), then B's new priority\nis 5, not 8.\nCan a thread's priority change while it is on the ready queue?\nYes. Consider a ready, low-priority thread L that holds a lock. High-priority\nthread H attempts to acquire the lock and blocks, thereby donating its priority\nto ready thread L.\nCan a thread's priority change while it is blocked?\nYes. While a thread that has acquired lock L is blocked for any reason, its\npriority can increase by priority donation if a higher-priority thread attempts\nto acquire L. This case is checked by the priority-donate-sema test.\nCan a thread added to the ready list preempt the processor?\nYes. If a thread added to the ready list has higher priority than the running\nthread, the correct behavior is to immediately yield the processor. It is not\nacceptable to wait for the next timer interrupt. The highest priority thread\nshould run as soon as it is runnable, preempting whatever thread is currently\nrunning.\nHow does thread_set_priority() affect a thread receiving donations?\nIt sets the thread's base priority. The thread's effective priority becomes the\nhigher of the newly set priority or the highest donated priority. When the\ndonations are released, the thread's priority becomes the one set through the\nfunction call. This behavior is checked by the priority-donate-lower test.\nDoubled test names in output make them fail.\nSuppose you are seeing output in which some test names are doubled, like this:\n(alarm-priority) begin\n(alarm-priority) (alarm-priority) Thread priority 30 woke up.\nThread priority 29 woke up.\n(alarm-priority) Thread priority 28 woke up.\nWhat is happening is that output from two threads is being interleaved. That is,\none thread is printing (alarm-priority) Thread priority 29 woke up.\\n\nand another thread is printing (alarm-priority) Thread priority 30 woke up.\\n,\nbut the first thread is being preempted by the second in the middle of its\noutput. This problem indicates a bug in your priority scheduler. After all, a\nthread with priority 29 should not be able to run while a thread with priority\n30 has work to do. Normally, the implementation of the printf() function in\nthe Pintos kernel attempts to prevent such interleaved output by acquiring a\nconsole lock during the duration of the printf call and releasing it afterwards.\nHowever, the output of the test name, e.g., (alarm-priority), and the message\nfollowing it is output using two calls to printf, resulting in the console lock\nbeing acquired and released twice.\nHow does priority donation interact with the advanced scheduler?\nIt doesn't have to. We won't test priority donation and the advanced scheduler\nat the same time.\nCan I use one queue instead of 64 queues?\nYes. In general, your implementation may differ from the description, as long\nas its behavior is the same.\nSome scheduler tests fail and I don't understand why. Help!\nIf your implementation mysteriously fails some of the advanced scheduler tests,\ntry the following:\n\nRead the source files for the tests that you're failing, to make sure that\nyou understand what's going on. Each one has a comment at the top that\nexplains its purpose and expected results.\nDouble-check your fixed-point arithmetic routines and your use of them in\nthe scheduler routines.\nConsider how much work your implementation does in the timer interrupt.\nIf the timer interrupt handler takes too long, then it will take away most of\na timer tick from the thread that the timer interrupt preempted. When it\nreturns control to that thread, it therefore won't get to do much work before\nthe next timer interrupt arrives. That thread will therefore get blamed for\na lot more CPU time than it actually got a chance to use. This raises the\ninterrupted thread's recent CPU count, thereby lowering its priority. It\ncan cause scheduling decisions to change. It also raises the load average.\n\n"},"appendix/threads.html":{"url":"appendix/threads.html","title":"Threads","keywords":"","body":"Threads\nstruct thread\nThe main Pintos data structure for threads is struct thread, declared in\nthreads/thread.h.\n\nstruct thread;\n\nRepresents a thread or a user process.

Ready threads are\nkept in a doubly linked list called ready_list.\n\nTHREAD_BLOCKED\nThe thread is waiting for something, e.g. a lock to become available, an\ninterrupt to be invoked. The thread won't be scheduled again until it\ntransitions to the THREAD_READY  state with a call to thread_unblock().\nThis is most conveniently done indirectly, using one of the Pintos\nsynchronization primitives that block and unblock threads automatically\n(see Synchronization). There is no a priori way to\ntell what a blocked thread is waiting for, but a backtrace can help\n(see Backtraces).\n\nTHREAD_DYING\nThe thread will be destroyed by the scheduler after switching to the next\nthread.\n\n\n\n\nchar name[16];\n\n\nThe thread's name as a string, or at least the first few characters of it.\n\n\nstruct intr_frame tf;\n\n\nStoring information for the context switching, which includes registers,\nand stack pointer.\n\n\nint priority;\n\n\nA thread priority, ranging from PRI_MIN (0) to PRI_MAX (63).

Stack overflow tends to change this value, triggering the\nassertion. For greatest benefit, as you add members to struct thread, leave\nmagic at the end.\n\nThread Functions\nthreads/thread.c implements several public functions for thread support.\nLet's take a look at the most useful:\n\nvoid thread_init (void);\n\n\nCalled by main() to initialize the thread system. Its main purpose is to\ncreate a struct thread for Pintos's initial thread. This is possible because\nthe Pintos loader puts the initial thread's stack at the top of a page, in the\nsame position as any other Pintos thread.\nBefore thread_init() runs, thread_current() will fail because the running\nthread's magic value is incorrect. Lots of functions call thread_current()\ndirectly or indirectly, including lock_acquire() for locking a lock, so\nthread_init() is called early in Pintos initialization.\n\n\nvoid thread_start (void);\n\n\nCalled by main() to start the scheduler. Creates the idle thread, that is,\nthe thread that is scheduled when no other thread is ready. Then enables\ninterrupts, which as a side effect enables the scheduler because the scheduler\nruns on return from the timer interrupt, using intr_yield_on_return().\n\n\nvoid thread_tick (void);\n\n\nCalled by the timer interrupt at each timer tick. It keeps track of thread\nstatistics and triggers the scheduler when a time slice expires.\n\n\nvoid thread_print_stats (void);\n\n\nCalled during Pintos shutdown to print thread statistics.\n\n\ntid_t thread_create (const char *name, int priority, thread func *func, void *aux);\n\n\nCreates and starts a new thread named name with the given priority, returning\nthe new thread's tid. The thread executes func, passing aux as the function's\nsingle argument.\nthread_create() allocates a page for the thread's struct thread and stack\nand initializes its members, then it sets up a set of fake stack frames for\nit. The thread is initialized in the blocked state, then unblocked just before\nreturning, which allows the new thread to be scheduled.\n\n\nvoid thread_func (void *aux);\n\n\nThis is the type of the function passed to thread_create(), whose aux\nargument is passed along as the function's argument.\n\n\nvoid thread_block (void);\n\n\nTransitions the running thread from the running state to the blocked state.\nThe thread will not run again until thread_unblock() is called on it, so\nyou'd better have some way arranged for that to happen. Because\nthread_block() is so low-level, you should prefer to use one of the\nsynchronization primitives instead\n(see Synchronization).\n\n\nvoid thread_unblock (struct thread *thread);\n\n\nTransitions thread, which must be in the blocked state, to the ready state,\nallowing it to resume running. This is called when the event that the thread\nis waiting for occurs, e.g. when the lock that the thread is waiting on\nbecomes available.\n\n\nstruct thread *thread_current (void);\n\n\nReturns the running thread.\n\n\ntid_t thread_tid (void);\n\n\nReturns the running thread's thread id.\nEquivalent to thread_current ()->tid.\n\n\nconst char *thread_name (void);\n\n\nReturns the running thread's name. Equivalent to thread_current ()->name.\n\n\nvoid thread_exit (void) NO_RETURN;\n\n\nCauses the current thread to exit.

This is especially the case\nin operating system kernels, where faulty sharing can crash the entire machine.\nPintos provides several synchronization primitives to help out.\nDisabling Interrupts\nThe crudest way to do synchronization is to disable interrupts, that is, to\ntemporarily prevent the CPU from responding to interrupts. If interrupts are\noff, no other thread will preempt the running thread, because thread preemption\nis driven by the timer interrupt. If interrupts are on, as they normally are,\nthen the running thread may be preempted by another at any time, whether between\ntwo C statements or even within the execution of one.\nIncidentally, this means that Pintos is a \"preemptible kernel,\" that is, kernel\nthreads can be preempted at any time. Traditional Unix systems are\n\"nonpreemptible,\" that is, kernel threads can only be preempted at points where\nthey explicitly call into the scheduler. (User programs can be preempted at any\ntime in both models.) As you might imagine, preemptible kernels require more\nexplicit synchronization.\nYou should have litthe need to set the interrupt state directly. Most of the\ntime you should use the other synchronization primitives described in the\nfollowing sections. The main reason to disable interrupts is to synchronize\nkernel threads with external interrupt handlers, which cannot sleep and thus\ncannot use most other forms of synchronization.\nSome external interrupts cannot be postponed, even by disabling interrupts.\nThese interrupts, called non-maskable interrupts (NMIs), are supposed to be\nused only in emergencies, e.g. when the computer is on fire. Pintos does not\nhandle non-maskable interrupts.\nTypes and functions for disabling and enabling interrupts are in\ninclude/threads/interrupt.h.\n\nenum intr_level;\n\n\nOne of INTR_OFF or INTR_ON, denoting that interrupts are disabled or\nenabled, resepectively.\n\n\nenum intr_level intr_get_level (void)\n\n\nReturns the current interrupt state.\n\n\nenum intr_level intr_set_level (enum intr_level level);\n\n\nTurns interrupts on or off according to level.

Returns the previos interrupt state.\n\n\nenum intr_level intr_disable (void);\n\n\nTurns interrupts off. Returns the previous interrupt state.\n\nSemaphores\nA semaphore is a nonnegative interger together with two operators that\nmanipulate it atomically, which are:\n\n\"Down\" or \"P\" : wait for the value to become positive, then decrement it.\n\"UP\" or \"V\": increment the value (and wake up one waiting thread, if any).\n\nA semaphore initialized to 0 may be used to wait for an event that will happen\nexactly once. For example, suppose thread A starts another thread B and wants to\nwait for B to signal that some activity is complete. A can create a semaphore\ninitialized to 0, pass it to B as it starts it, and then \"down\" the semaphore.\nWhen B finishes its activity, it \"ups\" the semaphore. This works regardless of\nwhether A \"downs\" the semaphore or B \"ups\" it first.\nA semaphore initialized to 1 is typically used for controlling access to a\nresource. Before a block of code starts using the resource, it \"downs\" the\nsemaphore, then after it is done with the resource it \"ups\" the resource. In\nsuch a case a lock, described below, may be more appropriate.\nSemaphores can also be initialized to values larger than 1. These are rarely\nused. Semaphores were invented by Edsger Dijkstra and first used in the THE\noperating system. Pintos' semaphore type and operations are declared in\ninclude/threads/synch.h.\n\nstruct semaphore;\n\n\nRepresents a semaphore.\n\n\nvoid sema_init (struct semaphore *sema, unsigned value);\n\n\nInitializes sema as a new semaphore with the given initial value.\n\n\nvoid sema_down (struct semaphore *sema);\n\nExecutes the \"down\" or \"P\" operation on sema, waiting for its value to become\npositive and then decrementing it by one.\n\nbool sema_try_down (struct semaphore *sema);\n\n\nTries to execute the \"down\" or \"P\" operation on sema, without waiting. Returns\ntrue if sema was successfully decremented, or false if it was already zero and\nthus could not be decremented without waiting. Calling this function in a\ntight loop wastes CPU time, so use sema_down() or find a different approach\ninstead.\n\n\nvoid sema_up (struct semaphore *sema);\n\n\nExecutes the \"up\" or \"V\" operation on sema, incrementing its value. If any\nthreads are waiting on sema, wakes one of them up. Unlike most synchronization\nprimitives, sema_up() may be called inside an external interrupt handler.\n\nSemaphores are internally built out of disabling interrupt\n(see Disabling Interrupts) and thread blocking and\nunblocking (thread_block() and thread_unblock()). Each semaphore maintains\na list of waiting threads, using the linked list implementation in\nlib/kernel/list.c.\nLocks\nA lock is like a semaphore with an initial value of 1\n(see Semaphores). A lock's equivalent of \"up\" is called\n\"release\", and the \"down\" operation is called \"acquire\".\nCompared to a semaphore, a lock has one added restriction: only the trhead that\nacquires a lock, called the lock's \"owner\", is allowed to release it. If this\nrestriction is a problem, it's a good sign that a semaphore should be used,\ninstead of a lock.\nLocks in Pintos are not \"recursive,\" that is, it is an error for the thread\ncurrently holding a lock to try to acquire that lock.\nLock types and functions are declared in include/threads/synch.h.\n\nstruct lock;\n\n\nRepresents a lock.\n\n\nvoid lock_init (struct lock *lock);\n\n\nInitializes lock as a new lock. The lock is not initially owned by any thread.\n\n\nvoid lock_acquire (struct lock *lock);\n\n\nAcquires lock for the current thread, first waiting for any current owner to\nrelease it if necessary.\n\n\nbool lock_try_acquire (struct lock *lock);\n\n\nTries to acquire lock for use by the current thread, without waiting. Returns\ntrue if successful, false if the lock is already owned. Calling this function\nin a tight loop is a bad idea because it wastes CPU time, so use\nlock_acquire() instead.\n\n\nvoid lock_release (struct lock *lock);\n\n\nReleases lock, which the current thread must own.\n\n\nbool lock_held_by_current_thread (const struct lock *lock):\n\n\nReturns true if the running thread owns lock, false otherwise. There is no\nfunction to test whether an arbitrary thread owns a lock, because the answer\ncould change before the caller could act on it.\n\nMonitors\nA monitor is a higher-level form of synchronization than a semaphore or a lock.\nA monitor consists of data being synchronized, plus a lock, called the monitor\nlock, and one or more condition variables. Before it accesses the protected\ndata, a thread first acquires the monitor lock. It is then said to be\n\"in the monitor\". While in the monitor, the thread has control over all the\nprotected data, which it may freely examine or modify. When access to the\nprotected data is complete, it releases the monitor lock.\nCondition variables allow code in the monitor to wait for a condition to become\ntrue. Each condition variable is associated with an abstract condition, e.g.\n\"some data has arrived for processing\" or \"over 10 seconds has passed since the\nuser's last keystroke\". When code in the monitor needs to wait for a condition\nto become true, it \"waits\" on the associated condition variable, which releases\nthe lock and waits for the condition to be signaled. If, on the other hand, it\nhas caused one of these conditions to become true, it \"signals\" the condition to\nwake up one waiter, or \"broadcasts\" the condition to wake all of them.\nThe theoretical framework for monitors was laid out by C.A.R.Hoare. Their\npractical usage was later elaborated in a paper on the Mesa operation system.\nCondition variable types and functions are declared in\ninclude/threads/synch.h.\n\nstruct condition;\n\n\nRepresents a condition variable.\n\n\nvoid cond_init (struct condition *cond);\n\n\nInitializes cond as a new condition variable.\n\n\nvoid cond_wait (struct condition *cond, struct lock *lock);\n\n\nAtomically releases lock (the monitor lock) and waits for cond to be signaled\nby some other piece of code. After cond is signaled, reacquires lock before\nreturning. lock must be held before calling this function. Sending a signal\nand waking up from a wait are not an atomic operation. Thus, typically\ncond_wait()'s caller must recheck the condition after the wait completes\nand, if necessary, wait again. See the next section for an example.\n\n\nvoid cond_signal (struct condition *cond, struct lock *lock);\n\n\nIf any threads are waiting on cond (protected by monitor lock lock), then this\nfunction wakes up one of them. If no threads are waiting, returns without\nperforming any action. lock must be held before calling this function.\n\n\nvoid cond_broadcast (struct condition *cond, struct lock *lock);\n\n\nWakes up all threads, if any, waiting on cond (protected by monitor lock\nlock). lock must be held before calling this function.\n\nMonitor Example\nThe classical example of a monitor is handling a buffer into which one or more\n\"producer\" threads write characters and out of which one or more \"consumer\"\nthreads read characters. To implement this we need, besides the monitor lock,\ntwo condition variables which we will call not_full and not_empty:\n    char buf[BUF_SIZE];     /* Buffer. */\n    size_t n = 0;         /* 0 \nNote that BUF_SIZE must divide evenly into SIZE_MAX + 1 for the above code\nto be completely correct. Otherwise, it will fail the first time head wraps\naround to 0. In practice, BUF_SIZE would ordinarily be a power of 2.\nOptimization Barriers\nAn optimization barrier is a special statement that prevents the compiler from\nmaking assumptions about the state of memory across the barrier. The compiler\nwill not reorder reads or writes of variables across the barrier or assume that\na variable's value is unmodified across the barrier, except for local variables\nwhose address is never taken. In Pintos, include/threads/synch.h defines the\nbarrier() macro as an optimization barrier.\nOne reason to use an optimization barrier is when data can change\nasynchronously, without the compiler's knowledge, e.g. by another thread or an\ninterrupt handler. The too_many_loops() function in devices/timer.c is an\nexample. This function starts out by busy-waiting in a loop until a timer tick\noccurs:\n    /* Wait for a timer tick. */\n    int64_t start = ticks;\n    while (ticks == start)\n        barrier();\n\nWithout an optimization barrier in the loop, the compiler could conclude that\nthe loop would never terminate, because start and ticks start out equal and\nthe loop itself never changes them. It could then \"optimize\" the function into\nan infinite loop, which would definitely be undesirable.\nOptimization barriers can be used to avoid other compiler optimizations. The\nbusy_wait() function, also in devices/timer.c, is an example. It contains\nthis loop:\n    while (loops-- > 0)\n      barrier ();\n\nThe goal of this loop is to busy-wait by counting loops down from its original\nvalue to 0. Without the barrier, the compiler could delete the loop entirely,\nbecause it produces no useful output and has no side effects. The barrier forces\nthe compiler to pretend that the loop body has an important effect.\nFinally, optimization barriers can be used to force the ordering of memory reads\nor writes. For example, suppose we add a \"feature\" that, whenever a timer\ninterrupt occurs, the character in global variable timer_put_char is printed\non the console, but only if global Boolean variable timer_do_put is true. The\nbest way to set up x to be printed is then to use an optimization barrier,\nlike this:\n    timer_put_char = 'x';\n    barrier ();\n    timer_do_put = true;\n\nWithout the barrier, the code is buggy because the compiler is free to reorder\noperations when it doesn't see a reason to keep them in the same order. In this\ncase, the compiler doesn't know that the order of assignments is important, so\nits optimizer is permitted to exchange their order. There's no telling whether\nit will actually do this, and it is possible that passing the compiler different\noptimization flags or using a different version of the compiler will produce\ndifferent behavior.\nAnother solution is to disable interrupts around the assignments. This does not\nprevent reordering, but it prevents the interrupt handler from intervening\nbetween the assignments. It also has the extra runtime cost of disabling and\nre-enabling interrupts:\n    enum intr_level old_level = intr_disable ();\n    timer_put_char = 'x';\n    timer_do_put = true;\n    intr_set_level (old_level);\n\nA second solution is to mark the declarations of timer_put_char and\ntimer_do_put as volatile. This keyword tells the compiler that the variables\nare externally observable and restricts its latitude for optimization. However,\nthe semantics of volatile are not well defined, so it is not a good general\nsolution. The base Pintos code does not use volatile at all.\nThe following is not a solution, because locks neither prevent interrupts nor\nprevent the compiler from reordering the code within the region where the lock\nis held:\n    lock_acquire (&timer_lock);        /* INCORRECT CODE */\n    timer_put_char = 'x';\n    timer_do_put = true;\n    lock_release (&timer_lock);\n\nThe compiler treats invocation of any function defined externally, that is, in\nanother source file, as a limited form of optimization barrier. Specifically,\nthe compiler assumes that any externally defined function may access any\nstatically or dynamically allocated data and any local variable whose address is\ntaken. This often means that explicit barriers can be omitted. It is one reason\nthat Pintos contains few explicit barriers.\nA function defined in the same source file, or in a header included by the\nsource file, cannot be relied upon as a optimization barrier. This applies even\nto invocation of a function before its definition, because the compiler may read\nand parse the entire source file before performing optimization.\n"},"appendix/memory_allocation.html":{"url":"appendix/memory_allocation.html","title":"Memory Allocation","keywords":"","body":"Memory Allocation\nPintos contains two memory allocators, one that allocates memory in units of a\npage, and one that can allocate blocks of any size.\nPage Allocator\nThe page allocator declared in include/threads/palloc.h allocates memory\nin units of a page. It is most often used to allocate memory one page at a time,\nbut it can also allocate multiple contiguous pages at once.\nThe page allocator divides the memory it allocates into two pools, called the\nkernel and user pools. By default, each pool gets half of system memory above\n1MB, but the division can be changed with the ul kernel command line option.\nAn allocation request draws from one pool or the other. If one pool becomes\nempty, the other may still have free pages. The user pool should be used for\nallocating memory for user processes and the kernel pool for all other\nallocations. This will only become important starting with project 3. Until\nthen, all allocations should be made from the kernel pool.\nEach pool's usage is tracked with a bitmap, one bit per page in the pool. A\nrequest to allocate n pages scans the bitmap for n consecutive bits set to\nfalse, indicating that those pages are free, and then sets those bits to true to\nmark them as used. This is a \"first fit\" allocation strategy.\nThe page allocator is subject to fragmentation. That is, it may not be possible\nto allocate n contiguous pages even though n or more pages are free, because\nthe free pages are separated by used pages. In fact, in pathological cases it\nmay be impossible to allocate 2 contiguous pages even though half of the pool's\npages are free. Single-page requests can't fail due to fragmentation, so\nrequests for multiple contiguous pages should be limited as much as possible.\nPages may not be allocated from interrupt context, but they may be freed.\nWhen a page is freed, all of its bytes are cleared to 0xcc, as a debugging\naid (see Debugging Tips).\nPage allocator types and functions are described below.\n\nvoid *palloc_get_page (enum palloc_flags flags)\nvoid *palloc_get_multiple (enum palloc_flags flags, size_t page_cnt)\n\n\nObtains and returns one page, or page_cnt contiguous pages, respectively.\nReturns a null pointer if the pages cannot be allocated.\nThe flags argument may be any combination of the following flags:\n\nPAL_ASSERT\n If the pages cannot be allocated, panic the kernel. This is only appropriate\n during kernel initialization. User processes should never be permitted to\n panic the kernel.\n\nPAL_ZERO\n Zero all the bytes in the allocated pages before returning them.\n If not set, the contents of newly allocated pages are unpredictable.\n\nPAL_USER\n Obtain the pages from the user pool. If not set, pages are allocated from\n the kernel pool.\n\n\n\n\nvoid palloc_free_page (void *page)\nvoid palloc_free_multiple (void *pages, size_t page_cnt)\n\n\nFrees one page, or page cnt contiguous pages, respectively, starting at\npages. All of the pages must have been obtained using palloc_get_page()\nor palloc_get_multiple().\n\nBlock Allocator\nThe block allocator, declared in threads/malloc.h, can allocate blocks of any\nsize. It is layered on top of the page allocator described in the previous\nsection. Blocks returned by the block allocator are obtained from the kernel\npool.\nThe block allocator uses two different strategies for allocating memory. The\nfirst strategy applies to blocks that are 1 kB or smaller\n(one-fourth of the page size). These allocations are rounded up to the nearest\npower of 2, or 16 bytes, whichever is larger. Then they are grouped into a page\nused only for allocations of that size.\nThe second strategy applies to blocks larger than 1 kB. These allocations\n(plus a small amount of overhead) are rounded up to the nearest page in size,\nand then the block allocator requests that number of contiguous pages from the\npage allocator.\nIn either case, the difference between the allocation requested size and the\nactual block size is wasted. A real operating system would carefully tune its\nallocator to minimize this waste, but this is unimportant in an instructional\nsystem like Pintos.\nAs long as a page can be obtained from the page allocator, small allocations\nalways succeed. Most small allocations do not require a new page from the page\nallocator at all, because they are satisfied using part of a page already\nallocated. However, large allocations always require calling into the page\nallocator, and any allocation that needs more than one contiguous page can fail\ndue to fragmentation, as already discussed in the previous section. Thus, you\nshould minimize the number of large allocations in your code, especially those\nover approximately 4 kB each.\nWhen a block is freed, all of its bytes are cleared to 0xcc, as a debugging\naid (see Debugging Tips).\nThe block allocator may not be called from interrupt context.\nThe block allocator functions are described below. Their interfaces are the same\nas the standard C library functions of the same names.\n\nvoid *malloc (size_t size)\n\n\nObtains and returns a new block, from the kernel pool, at least size bytes long.\nReturns a null pointer if size is zero or if memory is not available.\n\n\nvoid *calloc (size_t a, size_t b)\n\n\nObtains a returns a new block, from the kernel pool, at least a * b bytes\nlong. The block's contents will be cleared to zeros. Returns a null pointer if\na or b is zero or if insufficient memory is available.\n\n\nvoid *realloc (void *block, size_t new_size)\n\n\nAttempts to resize block to new_size bytes, possibly moving it in the\nprocess. If successful, returns the new block, in which case the old block\nmust no longer be accessed. On failure, returns a null pointer, and the old\nblock remains valid. A call with block null is equivalent to malloc(). A\ncall with new size zero is equivalent to free().\n\n\nvoid free (void *block)\n\n\nFrees block, which must have been previously returned by malloc(),\ncalloc(), or realloc() (and not yet freed).\n\n"},"appendix/virtual_address.html":{"url":"appendix/virtual_address.html","title":"Virtual Address","keywords":"","body":"Virtual Addresses\nA 64-bit virtual addresses are structured as follows:\n63          48 47            39 38            30 29            21 20         12 11         0\n+-------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+-------------+------------+\n| Sign Extend |    Page-Map    | Page-Directory | Page-directory |  Page-Table |  Physical  |\n|             | Level-4 Offset |    Pointer     |     Offset     |   Offset    |   Offset   |\n+-------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+-------------+------------+\n              |                |                |                |             |            |\n              +------- 9 ------+------- 9 ------+------- 9 ------+----- 9 -----+---- 12 ----+\n                                          Virtual Address\nHeader include/threads/vaddr.h, and include/threads/mmu.h define these\nfunctions and macros for working with virtual addresses:\n\n#define PGSHIFT { /* Emit details */ }\n#define PGBITS { /* Emit details */ }\n\n\nThe bit index (0) and number of bits (12) of the offset part of a virtual\naddress, respectively.\n\n\n#define PGMASK { /* Emit details */ }\n\n\nA bit mask with the bits in the page offset set to 1, the rest set to 0\n(0xfff).\n\n\n#define PGSIZE { /* Emit details */ }\n\n\nThe page size in bytes (4,096).\n\n\n#define pg_ofs(va) { /* Emit details */ }\n\n\nExtracts and returns the page offset in virtual address va.\n\n\n#define pg_no(va) { /* Emit details */ }\n\n\nExtracts and returns the page number in virtual address va.\n\n\n#define pg_round_down(va) { /* Emit details */ }\n\n\nReturns the start of the virtual page that va points within, that is, va\nwith the page offset set to 0.\n\n\n#define pg_round_up(va) { /* Emit details */ }\n\n\nReturns va rounded up to the nearest page boundary.\n\nVirtual memory in Pintos is divided into two regions: user virtual memory and\nkernel virtual memory (see Virtual Memory Layout).\nThe boundary between them is KERN_BASE:\n\n#define KERN_BASE { /* Emit details */ }\n\n\nBase address of kernel virtual memory.

This appendix introduces\nyou to a few of them.\nprintf()\nDon't underestimate the value of printf(). The way printf() is implemented\nin Pintos, you can call it from practically anywhere in the kernel, whether it's\nin a kernel thread or an interrupt handler, almost regardless of what locks are\nheld. printf() is useful for more than just examining data. It can also help\nfigure out when and where something goes wrong, even when the kernel crashes or\npanics without a useful error message. The strategy is to sprinkle calls to\nprintf() with different strings (e.g. \"\", \"\", . . . ) throughout the\npieces of code you suspect are failing. If you don't even see  printed, then\nsomething bad happened before that point, if you see  but not , then\nsomething bad happened between those two points, and so on. Based on what you\nlearn, you can then insert more printf() calls in the new, smaller region of\ncode you suspect. Eventually you can narrow the problem down to a single\nstatement. See Triple Faults,\nfor a related technique.\nASSERT\nAssertions are useful because they can catch problems early, before they'd\notherwise be noticed. Ideally, each function should begin with a set of\nassertions that check its arguments for validity. (Initializers for functions'\nlocal variables are evaluated before assertions are checked, so be careful not\nto assume that an argument is valid in an initializer.) You can also sprinkle\nassertions throughout the body of functions in places where you suspect things\nare likely to go wrong. They are especially useful for checking loop invariants.\nPintos provides the ASSERT macro, defined in , for checking\nassertions.\n#define ASSERT(expression) { /* Emit details */ }\n\nTests the value of expression. If it evaluates to zero (false), the kernel\npanics. The panic message includes the expression that failed, its file and\nline number, and a backtrace, which should help you to find the problem. See\nBacktraces for more information.\nFunction and Parameter Attributes\nThese macros defined in  tell the compiler special attributes of a\nfunction or function parameter. Their expansions are GCC-specific.\n\n#define UNUSED { /* Emit details */ }\n\n\nAppended to a function parameter to tell the compiler that the parameter might\nnot be used within the function. It suppresses the warning that would\notherwise appear.\n\n\n#define NO_RETURN { /* Emit details */ }\n\n\nAppended to a function prototype to tell the compiler that the function never\nreturns. It allows the compiler to fine-tune its warnings and its code\ngeneration.\n\n\n#define NO_INLINE { /* Emit details */ }\n\n\nAppended to a function prototype to tell the compiler to never emit the\nfunction in-line. Occasionally useful to improve the quality of backtraces\n(see below).\n\n\n#define PRINTF_FORMAT(format, first) { /* Emit details */ }\n\n\nAppended to a function prototype to tell the compiler that the function takes\na printf()-like format string as the argument numbered format (starting from\n1) and that the corresponding value arguments start at the argument numbered\nfirst. This lets the compiler tell you if you pass the wrong argument types.\n\nBacktraces\nWhen the kernel panics, it prints a \"backtrace,\" that is, a summary of how your\nprogram got where it is, as a list of addresses inside the functions that were\nrunning at the time of the panic. You can also insert a call to\ndebug_backtrace(), prototyped in , to print a backtrace at any\npoint in your code. debug_backtrace_all(), also declared in ,\nprints backtraces of all threads.\nThe addresses in a backtrace are listed as raw hexadecimal numbers, which are\ndifficult to interpret. We provide a tool called backtrace to translate these\ninto function names and source file line numbers. Give it the name of your\nkernel.o as the first argument and the hexadecimal numbers composing the\nbacktrace (including the 0x prefixes) as the remaining arguments. It outputs\nthe function name and source file line numbers that correspond to each address.\nIf the translated form of a backtrace is garbled, or doesn't make sense (e.g.\nfunction A is listed above function B, but B doesn't call A), then it's a good\nsign that you're corrupting a kernel thread's stack, because the backtrace is\nextracted from the stack. Alternatively, it could be that the kernel.o you\npassed to backtrace is not the same kernel that produced the backtrace.\nSometimes backtraces can be confusing without any corruption. Compiler\noptimizations can cause surprising behavior. When a function has called another\nfunction as its final action (a tail call), the calling function may not appear\nin a backtrace at all. Similarly, when function A calls another function B that\nnever returns, the compiler may optimize such that an unrelated function C\nappears in the backtrace instead of A. Function C is simply the function that\nhappens to be in memory just after A. In the threads project, this is commonly\nseen in backtraces for test failures.\nExample\nHere's an example. Suppose that Pintos printed out this following call stack,\nwhich is taken from an actual Pintos submission for the file system project:\nCall stack: 0x800426eff 0x8004202fb 0x80042dc22 0x80042cf67 0x800422319\n0x80042325a 0x40012c 0x400a96 0x400ac8.\n\nYou would then invoke the backtrace utility like shown below, cutting and\npasting the backtrace information into the command line. This assumes that\nkernel.o is in the current directory. You would of course enter all of the\nfollowing on a single shell command line, even though that would overflow our\nmargins here:\nbacktrace 0x800426eff 0x8004202fb 0x80042dc22 0x80042cf67 0x800422319\n0x80042325a 0x400012c 0x400a96 0x4000ac8\n\nThe backtrace output would then look something like this:\n0x0000000800426eff: debug_panic (lib/debug.c:86)\n0x00000008004202fb: file_seek (filesys/file.c:405)\n0x000000080042dc22: seek (userprog/syscall.c:744)\n0x000000080042cf67: syscall_handler (userprog/syscall.c:444)\n0x0000000800422319: intr_handler (threads/interrupt.c:334)\n0x000000080042325a: intr_entry (threads/intr-stubs.S:38)\n0x000000000040012c: (unknown)\n0x0000000000400a96: (unknown)\n0x0000000000400ac8: (unknown)\n\n(You will probably not see exactly the same addresses if you run the command\nabove on your own kernel binary, because the source code you compiled and the\ncompiler you used are probably different.)\nThe first line in the backtrace refers to debug_panic(), the function that\nimplements kernel panics. Because backtraces commonly result from kernel panics,\ndebug_panic() will often be the first function shown in a backtrace.\nThe second line shows file_seek() as the function that panicked, in this case\nas the result of an assertion failure. In the source code tree used for this\nexample, line 405 of filesys/file.c is the assertion\nASSERT (file_ofs >= 0);\n(This line was also cited in the assertion failure message.) Thus, file_seek()\npanicked because it passed a negative file offset argument.\nThe third line indicates that seek() called file_seek(), presumably without\nvalidating the offset argument. In this submission, seek() implements the seek\nsystem call. The fourth line shows that syscall_handler(), the system call\nhandler, invoked seek(). The fifth and sixth lines are the interrupt handler\nentry path. The remaining lines are for addresses below KERN_BASE. This means\nthat they refer to addresses in the user program, not in the kernel.\nGDB\nYou can run Pintos under the supervision of the GDB debugger. First, start\nPintos with the --gdb option, e.g. pintos --gdb -- run mytest. Second, open\na second terminal on the same machine and use gdb to invoke GDB on 'kernel.o'\ngdb kernel.o\nand issue the following GDB command:\ntarget remote localhost:1234\nNow GDB is connected to the simulator over a local network connection. You can\nnow issue any normal GDB commands. If you issue the 'c' command, the simulated\nBIOS will take control, load Pintos, and then Pintos will run in the usual way.\nYou can pause the process at any point with Ctrl+C.\nUsing GDB\nYou can read the GDB manual by typing info gdb at a terminal command prompt.\nHere's a few commonly useful GDB commands:\n\nc [GDB Command]\n\n\nContinues execution until hCtrl+Ci or the next breakpoint.\n\n\nbreak function [GDB Command]\n\nbreak file:line [GDB Command]\n\nbreak address [GDB Command]\n\n\n\nSets a breakpoint at function, at line within file, or address. (Use a '0x'\nprefix to specify an address in hex.)\nUse break main to make GDB stop when Pintos starts running.\n\n\np expression [GDB Command]\n\n\nEvaluates the given expression and prints its value. If the expression\ncontains a function call, that function will actually be executed.\n\n\nl address [GDB Command]\n\n\nLists a few lines of code around address. (Use a '0x' prefix to specify an\naddress in hex.)\n\n\nbt [GDB Command]\n\n\nPrints a stack backtrace similar to that output by the backtrace program\ndescribed above.\n\n\np/a address [GDB Command]\n\n\nPrints the name of the function or variable that occupies address. (Use a\n'0x' prefix to specify an address in hex.)\n\n\ndiassemble function [GDB Command]\n\n\nDisassembles function.\n\nHere's an extra tip for anyone who read this: install gdb script such as\npwndbg. This makes your life easier!\nFAQ\n\nCan I use GDB inside Emacs?\n\n\nYes, you can. Emacs has special support for running GDB as a subprocess.\nType M-x gdb and enter your pintos-gdb command at the prompt. The Emacs\nmanual has information on how to use its debugging features in a section\ntitled \"Debuggers.\"\n\n\nGDB is doing something weird.\n\n\nIf you notice strange behavior while using GDB, there are three possibilities:\na bug in your modified Pintos, a bug in Bochs's interface to GDB or in GDB\nitself, or a bug in the original Pintos code. The first and second are quite\nlikely, and you should seriously consider both. We hope that the third is less\nlikely, but it is also possible.\n\nTriple Faults\nWhen a CPU exception handler, such as a page fault handler, cannot be invoked\nbecause it is missing or defective, the CPU will try to invoke the \"double\nfault\" handler. If the double fault handler is itself missing or defective,\nthat's called a \"triple fault.\" A triple fault causes an immediate CPU reset.\nThus, if you get yourself into a situation where the machine reboots in a loop,\nthat's probably a \"triple fault.\" In a triple fault situation, you might not be\nable to use printf() for debugging, because the reboots might be happening\neven before everything needed for printf() is initialized.\nThere exists way to debug triple faults.\nPick a place in the Pintos code, insert the infinite loop for (;;); there, and\nrecompile and run. There are two likely possibilities:\n\nThe machine hangs without rebooting. If this happens, you know that the\ninfinite loop is running. That means that whatever caused the reboot must be\nafter the place you inserted the infinite loop. Now move the infinite loop\nlater in the code sequence.\n\nThe machine reboots in a loop. If this happens, you know that the machine\ndidn't make it to the infinite loop. Thus, whatever caused the reboot must be\nbefore the place you inserted the infinite loop. Now move the infinite loop\nearlier in the code sequence.\nIf you move around the infinite loop in a \"binary search\" fashion, you can use\nthis technique to pin down the exact spot that everything goes wrong. It\nshould only take a few minutes at most.\n\n\nTips\nThe page allocator in threads/palloc.c and the block allocator in\nthreads/malloc.c clear all the bytes in memory to '0xcc' at time of free.\nThus, if you see an attempt to dereference a pointer like 0xcccccccc, or some\nother reference to 0xcc, there's a good chance you're trying to reuse a page\nthat's already been freed. Also, byte 0xcc is the CPU opcode for \"invoke\ninterrupt 3,\" so if you see an error like Interrupt 0x03 (#BP Breakpoint\nException), then Pintos tried to execute code in a freed page or block. An\nassertion failure on the expression sec_no capacity indicates that Pintos\ntried to access a file through an inode that has been closed and freed. Freeing\nan inode clears its starting sector number to 0xcccccccc, which is not a valid\nsector number for disks smaller than about 1.6 TB.\n"},"appendix/development_tools.html":{"url":"appendix/development_tools.html","title":"Development Tools","keywords":"","body":"Development Tools\nHere are some tools that you might find useful while developing code.\nTags\nTags are an index to the functions and global variables declared in a program.\nMany editors, including Emacs and vi, can use them. The Makefile in\npintos/ produces Emacs-style tags with the command make TAGS or vi-style\ntags with make tags.\nIn Emacs, use M-. to follow a tag in the current window, C-x 4 . in a new\nwindow, or C-x 5 . in a new frame. If your cursor is on a symbol name for any\nof those commands, it becomes the default target. If a tag name has multiple\ndefinitions, M-0 M-. jumps to the next one. To jump back to where you were\nbefore you followed the last tag, use M-*.\ncscope\nThe cscope program also provides an index to functions and variables declared\nin a program. It has some features that tag facilities lack. Most notably, it\ncan find all the points in a program at which a given function is called.\nThe Makefile in pintos/ produces cscope indexes when it is invoked as\nmake cscope. Once the index has been generated, run cscope from a shell\ncommand line; no command-line arguments are normally necessary. Then use the\narrow keys to choose one of the search criteria listed near the bottom of the\nterminal, type in an identifier, and hit Enter. cscope will then display\nthe matches in the upper part of the terminal. You may use the arrow keys to\nchoose a particular match; if you then hit Enter, cscope will invoke the\ndefault system editor 1 and position the cursor on that match. To start a\nnew search, type Tab. To exit cscope, type Ctrl-d.\nEmacs and some versions of vi have their own interfaces to cscope. For\ninformation on how to use these interface, visit the cscope home page\n(http://cscope.sourceforge.net).\n\n1. This is typically vi. To exit vi, type :q Enter. ↩\n\n"}}}
